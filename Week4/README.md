# Week 4: CNN from Scratch for Image Classification

This folder contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch for image classification on the MIT Indoor Scenes dataset.

## Overview

Unlike Week 3 where we used pretrained models (MNASNet), in Week 4 we build and train a CNN architecture from scratch. The implementation follows similar structure to Week 3 with wandb logging, shell scripts, and proper experiment tracking.

## Key Differences from Week 3

- **No Pretrained Models**: All models are built and trained from scratch
- **Simple CNN Architecture**: 4 convolutional blocks with increasing channels (32→64→128→256)
- **Focus on Fundamentals**: Understanding CNN training dynamics without transfer learning
